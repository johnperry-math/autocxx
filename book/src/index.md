# autocxx â€” automatic safe interop between Rust and C++

`autocxx` is like `bindgen`, in that it enables you to use C++ functions and types from within Rust. It automates a lot of the fiddly things you need to do with `bindgen` bindings: calling destructors, converting strings, unsafely handling raw pointers. C++ functions and types within `autocxx` bindings should behave naturally and ergonomically, almost as if they were safe Rust functions and types themselves. These ergonomics and safety improvements come from the [cxx](https://cxx.rs) project - hence the name of this tool, `autocxx`.

`autocxx` combines the safety and ergonomics of `cxx` with the automatic bindings generation of `bindgen`.
